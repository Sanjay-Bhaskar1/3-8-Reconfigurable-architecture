This project implements a 3×8 Reconfigurable Computing Architecture; however, instead of designing it as a fully connected architecture, I have made direct connections in the main code. This approach was taken intentionally, as I am concurrently developing another project—a fully connected Reconfigurable Computing Architecture.

The fully connected version will allow complete reconfiguration using only the testbench, making it highly adaptable. Additionally, it is designed to be low-power and low-area, which enhances its practicality for modern-day applications where energy efficiency and compact design are crucial.
